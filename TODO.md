# TODO (in order of what I plan to do)

- Finish the README (welp)
- Work on user permission system quite a bit
- Implement chat logging
- Figure out a method to integrate other platforms (Discord (experimental support currently), IRC, etc)
- Work on making the module system more streamlined and flexible (kind of ties into permission system as well)
- Work on adding more included modules
- Document the process of making modules for the bot, as well as documenting how to use the bot in general
- There's more... just have to sit down and remember them
