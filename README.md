# pytwitchbot
pyTwitchbot is a (work in progress) Twitch chat bot written in Python using the Twisted framework. pyTwitchbot is based off of one of my older projects, py-ircbot, 
which has been adapted to connect to Twitch's IRC to provide modular chat bot functionality to a stream's chat. pyTwitchbot also currently has experimental Discord support to interface between Twitch chat and Discord chat, 
creating even more possibilities in terms of modules and functionality.

# Dependencies
In order to utilize the bot, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3.x (developed under 3.6 currently)
- Twisted
- discord.py
- pyOpenSSL 
- service_identity
- PyGithub (optional, for github module)

After all of the dependencies are installed:
- Copy the example configuration below and save it as pytwitchbot.conf in the pytwitchbot folder (same folder as pytwitchbot.py)
- Setup the config file to your liking, then simply launch the bot by executing pytwitchbot.py!
